       <p>
        Hello, my name is Gerson and I am in the App Development track in one of the prestigious program in Seattle
        called Year Up. I develop web sites that enhance small business brands. While I
        am open to work and internship that will further my knowledge in this field, I will love to have a coffee meeting with
        you.
       </p>
       
       <p>
        Few things to know about me is that I love computers, fitness and japanese culture. I'd suggest to click on my latest project "What I like in Life" and see what I am passionate about. 
       </p>

       <p>
        Even though I was born in Venezuela, I grew up in a Peruvian community. My dad is from Peru and my mom is from Venezuela. Having these two culture mixed up, I was able to identify both culture. By able to speak two Spanish accents, and understading the cultural lense that implies, I felt driven by diversity. Because of that, I see myself learning languages and culture. As now, I have been learning Japanese for 2 years. Every day, I am passionate to learn more about culture and one of my dream is to be in Japan and live there for a short period of time
